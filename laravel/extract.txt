----- this is basic ----
create project(laravel installation)
    laravel new blog(project name)
Directory Permissions
   storage  bootstrap/cache
Application Key
    A application is bind to a application.
    If you installed Laravel via Composer or the Laravel installer, this key has already been set for you by the  php artisan key:generate command.
    Typically, this string should be 32 characters long. The key can be set in the .env environment file. If you have not renamed the .env.example file to .env.
    If the application key is not set, your user sessions and other encrypted data will not be secure!
Config
    Laravel needs almost no other configuration out of the box. 
Nginx
    location / {
	try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }
